2. **Keyword Weight Editing**: UI for editing keyword weights is not yet implemented
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The improved categories page needs better mobile support
4. **Performance**: Category management could be optimized for large numbers of rules

## Recent Milestones

   - Enhanced component architecture with specialized components
   - Two-panel layout for better UX
   - Intuitive forms for rule management
   - Visual indicators for system vs. user items
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Weight management for sender rules

2. **Mar 2023**: ML classification system for trash category
   - Training interface for the classifier

     - All other categories have INBOX but not TRASH
   - Confirmed by database and UI validation
