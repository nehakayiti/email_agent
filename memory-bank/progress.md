2. **Keyword Weight Editing**: UI for editing keyword weights is not yet implemented
3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: The improved categories page needs better mobile support
4. **Performance**: Category management could be optimized for large numbers of rules

## Recent Milestones

1. **Apr 2023**: Improved category management UI with full CRUD operations
   - Enhanced component architecture with specialized components
   - Two-panel layout for better UX
   - Intuitive forms for rule management
   - Visual indicators for system vs. user items
   - Toast notifications for user feedback
   - Weight management for sender rules

2. **Mar 2023**: ML classification system for trash category
   - Training interface for the classifier
   - Model metrics and evaluation
   - Email bootstrapping for training data

3. **Feb 2023**: Basic category management and email viewing
   - Email detail view with content rendering
   - Basic category management UI
   - System categories initialization

4. **Apr 2025**: Robust label/category consistency enforcement
   - Fixed a critical import error that prevented label fixes during reprocessing
   - Now, reprocessing guarantees:
     - Trash emails have only the TRASH label (not INBOX)
     - Archive emails have neither INBOX nor TRASH
     - All other categories have INBOX but not TRASH
   - Confirmed by database and UI validation
