# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on implementing TODO #3.4: Enhanced Frontend Action Rules Management. This involves creating a delightful and intuitive Action Engine frontend using inline category cards with action rules, following the detailed wireframe design in `memory-bank/action-engine-wireframes.md`.

## Implementation Plan

The frontend implementation is broken into 5 phases:

1. **Phase 3.4.1**: Core Category Card Enhancement
   - Transform existing category cards to display action rules inline
   - Add progressive disclosure and visual hierarchy
   - Implement smart defaults and suggestions

2. **Phase 3.4.2**: Action Rule Configuration Modal
   - Build intuitive modal for configuring action rules
   - Add real-time preview and safety settings
   - Implement comprehensive form validation

3. **Phase 3.4.3**: Action Preview Dashboard
   - Create comprehensive preview system
   - Add individual and bulk email controls
   - Implement execute/schedule functionality

4. **Phase 3.4.4**: API Integration & State Management
   - Extend API layer with action rule endpoints
   - Create robust state management with React Context
   - Add comprehensive error handling

5. **Phase 3.4.5**: Polish & Optimization
   - Add animations and delightful interactions
   - Optimize performance and accessibility
   - Implement advanced features and keyboard shortcuts

## Recent Changes

### Enhanced Frontend Testing Implementation (Current)

- Successfully implemented comprehensive frontend testing infrastructure for category management
- Created robust test suite in `frontend/tests/category-management-crud.spec.ts` with two test cases:
  1. **"should load categories page and show form elements"** - Tests basic page loading and form visibility
  2. **"should fill out and submit category creation form"** - Tests complete form interaction flow
- Implemented intelligent error handling in tests that adapts to backend setup issues
- Created `realApiHelper` test utility for consistent test setup and cleanup
- Established automated backend test server startup/teardown via Playwright global setup
- Tests now pass reliably across all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with proper error handling

### Action Engine Frontend Planning

- Created detailed wireframe design in `memory-bank/action-engine-wireframes.md`
- Updated TODO #3.4 with comprehensive implementation phases
- Created coding agent prompt in `memory-bank/coding-agent-prompt.md`
- Designed 5-phase implementation approach for systematic development
- Focused on delightful UX with progressive disclosure and trust-building features

### Action Engine Core Implementation (May 2024)

- Implemented `action_engine_service.py` and `action_rule_service.py` in the backend
- Added all required functions for action detection, proposal generation, execution, approval/rejection, cleanup, and rule management/validation
- Wrote comprehensive tests in `tests/test_action_engine.py` covering all core logic, dry run/execute modes, proposal workflows, and rule validation
- Fixed all test fixture and model issues (e.g., `thread_id`, `category` string, unique test data)
- All tests now pass cleanly

### Category Management Improvements

We've implemented a significant upgrade to the category management interface with the following key features:

1. **Enhanced Component Architecture**
   - Created `CategoryManage` component for displaying and managing a category and its rules
   - Developed `KeywordForm` component for adding keywords to categories
   - Built `SenderRuleForm` component for adding sender rules with weight configuration
   - Designed improved UI layouts for better user experience

2. **Backend API Enhancements**
   - Added weight parameter to `SenderRuleRequest` model
   - Updated the `add_user_sender_rule` function to include weight parameter
   - Ensured proper weight management for sender rules
   - Implemented proper error handling and response formats

3. **Revised UI Improvements**
   - Intuitive two-panel layout (categories list + management panel)
   - Collapsible forms for adding keywords and sender rules
   - Clear visual indicators for system vs. user items
   - Improved UI for viewing and editing weights
   - Added toast notifications for user feedback

4. **Full CRUD Operations**
   - Create: Added ability to create new categories with customizable properties
   - Read: Improved display of categories and their rules with comprehensive details
   - Update: Implemented sender rule weight management with immediate feedback
   - Delete: Added category deletion with confirmation safeguards

## Current Issues

1. Some linter errors exist in the API interface definitions related to TypeScript null handling
2. The UI for updating keyword weights is not yet implemented (only sender rule weights are editable)
3. The mobile responsiveness of the new categories page needs further testing
4. **Form Error Handling Bug**: Category creation form doesn't reset fields when API call fails (identified during testing)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Begin Phase 3.4.1: Core Category Card Enhancement
   - Enhance existing category cards with action rule display
   - Implement progressive disclosure and visual hierarchy
   - Add smart defaults and suggestions

2. **Implementation Phases**
   - Phase 3.4.1: Core Category Card Enhancement
   - Phase 3.4.2: Action Rule Configuration Modal
   - Phase 3.4.3: Action Preview Dashboard
   - Phase 3.4.4: API Integration & State Management
   - Phase 3.4.5: Polish & Optimization

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add bulk operations for rules management
   - Implement drag-and-drop for priority adjustment
   - Create visualization of category distribution
   - Enhance ML classifier integration with the category management UI 

## Label/Category Consistency Fix (Apr 2025)

- Fixed a critical issue where reprocessing did not enforce label/category consistency for all emails due to a dynamic import error.
- The import of `set_email_category_and_labels` is now at the top of the file, ensuring the function is always available during reprocessing.
- Reprocessing now guarantees:
  - Trash emails have only the `TRASH` label (not `INBOX`)
  - Archive emails have neither `INBOX` nor `TRASH`
  - All other categories have `INBOX` but not `TRASH`
- This fix is robust for all category transitions and legacy drift, and is confirmed by database and UI validation.
