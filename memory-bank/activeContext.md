# Active Context

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the email category management system to provide more intuitive and comprehensive CRUD operations for categories and their associated rules.

## Recent Changes

### Category Management Improvements

We've implemented a significant upgrade to the category management interface with the following key features:

1. **Enhanced Component Architecture**
   - Created `CategoryManage` component for displaying and managing a category and its rules
   - Developed `KeywordForm` component for adding keywords to categories
   - Built `SenderRuleForm` component for adding sender rules with weight configuration
   - Designed improved UI layouts for better user experience

2. **Backend API Enhancements**
   - Added weight parameter to `SenderRuleRequest` model
   - Updated the `add_user_sender_rule` function to include weight parameter
   - Ensured proper weight management for sender rules
   - Implemented proper error handling and response formats

3. **Revised UI Improvements**
   - Intuitive two-panel layout (categories list + management panel)
   - Collapsible forms for adding keywords and sender rules
   - Clear visual indicators for system vs. user items
   - Improved UI for viewing and editing weights
   - Added toast notifications for user feedback

4. **Full CRUD Operations**
   - Create: Added ability to create new categories with customizable properties
   - Read: Improved display of categories and their rules with comprehensive details
   - Update: Implemented sender rule weight management with immediate feedback
   - Delete: Added category deletion with confirmation safeguards

## Current Issues

1. Some linter errors exist in the API interface definitions related to TypeScript null handling
2. The UI for updating keyword weights is not yet implemented (only sender rule weights are editable)
3. The mobile responsiveness of the new categories page needs further testing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Fix linter errors in API interfaces
   - Add keyword weight editing capability
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Add bulk operations for rules management
   - Implement drag-and-drop for priority adjustment
   - Create visualization of category distribution
   - Enhance ML classifier integration with the category management UI 

## Label/Category Consistency Fix (Apr 2025)

- Fixed a critical issue where reprocessing did not enforce label/category consistency for all emails due to a dynamic import error.
- The import of `set_email_category_and_labels` is now at the top of the file, ensuring the function is always available during reprocessing.
- Reprocessing now guarantees:
  - Trash emails have only the `TRASH` label (not `INBOX`)
  - Archive emails have neither `INBOX` nor `TRASH`
  - All other categories have `INBOX` but not `TRASH`
- This fix is robust for all category transitions and legacy drift, and is confirmed by database and UI validation.
