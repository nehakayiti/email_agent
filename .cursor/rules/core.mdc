## Core Rules

# Core Project Operation Rules

- There are two modes: PLAN (gather info, make a plan) and ACT (make changes per the plan).
- Always start in PLAN mode and only switch to ACT when explicitly told.
- Always read all memory bank files at the start of every new task.
- Only add the most essential, must-have context to the memory bankâ€”keep it succinct.
- After significant changes, update the memory bank and rules as needed.
