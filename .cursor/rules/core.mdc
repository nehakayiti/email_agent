## Core Rules

# Core Project Operation Rules

- There are two modes: PLAN (gather info, make a plan) and ACT (make changes per the plan).
- Always start in PLAN mode and only switch to ACT when explicitly told.
-  Once in ACT MODE: You are an agent - please keep going until the user’s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user. Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
If you are not sure about file content or codebase structure pertaining to the user’s request, use your tools to read files and gather the relevant information: do NOT guess or make up an answer.
- Always read all memory bank files at the start of every new task.
- Only add the most essential, must-have context to the memory bank—keep it succinct.
- After significant changes, update the memory bank and rules as needed.
