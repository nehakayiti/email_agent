## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project: AgentMailbox


### Overview
AgentMailbox is an advanced email management system designed to fully manage a user's Gmail account through a specialized agent interface. This system prioritizes user convenience by surfacing high-priority emails, summarizing content, and learning user preferences over time for promotional and social emails.

### Goals
- **High-Priority Email Surfacing**: Present high-priority emails to the user each morning for review.
- **Email Summarization**: Provide at-a-glance summaries of important news and blog feeds.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improve email categorization by learning from user interactions.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on functionality first, with iterative enhancements to the user experience based on feedback.

Prompt 1.1 – Assess Current OAuth Flow

Title: Assess Current OAuth Flow
Objective: Learn how the current authentication endpoints work and document any gaps.
Instructions:
• List all OAuth endpoints (e.g., “/auth/login”, “/auth/callback”) in your code.
• Use curl or Postman to send requests to these endpoints.
• Document the response status codes, tokens received, and error messages.
• Identify any missing functionality such as token refresh or logout.
Test/Validation:
• Verify that the “/auth/login” endpoint returns a redirect (e.g., HTTP 307).
• Confirm that “/auth/callback” processes tokens correctly or returns proper errors.
Notes:
• Record any security issues you notice.
• Keep the documentation in a shared file for later reference. ────────────────────────────────────────────── Prompt 1.2 – Enhance Token Management

Title: Enhance Token Management
Objective: Update token generation and storage to follow secure best practices using JWTs and proper expiry.
Instructions:
• Review your token generation code and update it to sign tokens securely (e.g., using JWT).
• Set token expiration and include a refresh mechanism.
• Add error handling for token refresh failures.
Test/Validation:
• Write unit tests that create tokens, decode them with a JWT tool, and verify the expiry and structure.

Notes:
• Document any changes to token handling for future audits. ────────────────────────────────────────────── Prompt 1.3 – Write Integration Tests for OAuth Endpoints

Title: Integration Tests for OAuth Endpoints
Objective: Build tests that verify the behavior of your authentication endpoints in real‑world scenarios.
Instructions:
• Create tests for “/auth/login” that confirm a proper redirect and valid location header.
• Write tests for “/auth/callback” that simulate both success (valid code) and error (invalid code, missing parameters) scenarios.
• Include tests that validate the JSON responses (e.g., token content, user data, error messages).
Test/Validation:
• Run the test suite and ensure all authentication flows (success and failure) pass.
• Verify edge cases are covered and error messages are clear.
Notes:
• Use clear, self‑documenting test names so that future refactoring is safe. ────────────────────────────────────────────── Prompt 2.1 – Implement Missing Endpoints (Refresh & Logout)

Title: Implement Refresh and Logout Endpoints
Objective: Complete your authentication API by adding endpoints for token refresh and logout.
Instructions:
• Add a “/auth/refresh” endpoint that validates and issues new tokens.
• Add a “/auth/logout” endpoint that properly invalidates tokens or clears sessions.
• Ensure both endpoints handle errors gracefully and return proper HTTP status codes.
Test/Validation:
• Write tests that simulate the refresh flow (valid token, expired token) and logout scenarios.
• Validate that responses meet security requirements and expected status codes.
Notes:
• Document the API changes in your API documentation. ────────────────────────────────────────────── Prompt 2.2 – Add Request Validation & Security Headers

Title: Secure API Requests with Validation and Headers
Objective: Protect your API endpoints by enforcing input validation and adding security headers.

• Add security headers (e.g., CORS, CSP, X-Content-Type-Options) to all responses.
• Update your API documentation with these security measures.
Test/Validation:
• Write tests that send invalid data and ensure that the API rejects them with appropriate error messages.
• Use browser tools or Postman to confirm that responses include the required security headers.
Notes:
• Regularly review and update security policies. ────────────────────────────────────────────── Prompt 2.3 – End-to-End Authentication Flow Testing (Backend)

Title: End-to-End Authentication Flow Testing (Backend)
Objective: Create a complete test that simulates a user’s authentication journey from login to token refresh and logout.
Instructions:

• Include both success and failure paths (e.g., expired tokens, invalid refresh attempts).
• Document expected responses for every step in the flow.
Test/Validation:
• Run the end-to-end tests (using pytest or a similar tool) and confirm all steps return the correct status codes and data.
