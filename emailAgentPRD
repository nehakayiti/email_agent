## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project: AgentMailbox

### Overview
AgentMailbox is an advanced email management system designed to fully manage a user's Gmail account through a specialized agent interface. This system prioritizes user convenience by surfacing high-priority emails, summarizing content, and learning user preferences over time for promotional and social emails.

### Goals
- **High-Priority Email Surfacing**: Present high-priority emails to the user each morning for review.
- **Email Summarization**: Provide at-a-glance summaries of important news and blog feeds.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Improve email categorization by learning from user interactions.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on functionality first, with iterative enhancements to the user experience based on feedback.

### User Experience

#### User Story
- As a user, I want to see high-priority emails each morning so that I can quickly address important matters.
- As a user, I want emails summarized to save time and focus on essential content.
- As a user, I want the system to learn my preferences for managing less important emails to reduce clutter.
- As a user, I want to easily categorize and surface important news and blogs in my agent inbox.

#### User Interaction Flow
1. **Morning Review**:
