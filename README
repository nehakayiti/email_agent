ToDo:

- Feature: I want category updates to be on the EA: Email List page vs. clicking the email to do the work
- Feature: I want to remove the "Sync Email" button and have it sync automatically. I want to see a timer until the next sync at the bottom left of the page in real time and small font. 
   - Should show last sync time and countdown to next sync time.
   - Tooltip to display the stats of the sync.

- Major Feature: 
   - EA should have ability for user to train the algorithm or model to improve the categorization.
   - EA should save all user interactions and use that data to improve the categorization.
   - Improve the email categorization algorithm by using a more sophisticated model.
   - Add a feature to auto-categorize emails based on their content.
   - Add a feature to auto-categorize emails based on the sender.
   - Add a feature to auto-categorize emails based on the subject.
   - Add a feature to auto-categorize emails based on the body.
   - Add a feature to auto-categorize emails based on the date.
   - Add a feature to auto-categorize emails based on the attachments.


Fixed:
- Feature: I want to add Mark as Read & Mark as Unread button to the EA: Email List page for each email.
- Bug: View in Gmail link is missing when you click on an email in EA
- Bug: Sync is working but when I delete emails in EA it is not deleting from Gmail, unless there is a change in the gmail history items for example: a new email is received in Gmail, then EA's update is synced.
- Feature: I want EA: All Emails to show all emails and not filtered by category.

# Email Agent Project Setup Guide

## Initial Setup

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>/backend
   ```

2. Set up Python environment:
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate virtual environment
   # For Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate
   # For Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   # Start FastAPI server with hot reload
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Database Setup
1. Start PostgreSQL container:
   ```bash
   # Launch database container
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. Access PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   # Connect to database
   docker exec -it postgres_db psql -U postgres -d email_agent_db
   ```

## Testing

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/emails/sync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/emails/?limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/emails/?category=work&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/emails/?limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>"

docker exec -it postgres_db psql -U postgres


Setting up the database:
   1. Run the docker compose file:
      docker compose up -d  # Start the docker container

   2. docker exec -it postgres_db psql -U postgres -d email_agent_db
   
   3. 
   
DB commands:
docker exec -it postgres_db psql -U postgres
\dt
SELECT * FROM emails;
SELECT * FROM emails LIMIT 10;
\q

RUN ALL TESTS:
pytest

RUN SPECIFIC TEST:
pytest tests/test_email_service.py

## API Usage Examples

### Email Operations
1. Sync emails:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/emails/sync" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
   ```

2. List all emails (paginated):
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/emails/?limit=50" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
   ```

3. Filter emails by category:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/emails/?category=work&limit=50" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_token>"
   ```

## Database Operations

### Common PostgreSQL Commands
Connect to PostgreSQL shell
docker exec -it postgres_db psql -U postgres
List all tables
\dt
View email records
SELECT FROM emails;
View limited email records
SELECT FROM emails LIMIT 10;
Exit PostgreSQL shell
\q

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
1. Verify container status:
